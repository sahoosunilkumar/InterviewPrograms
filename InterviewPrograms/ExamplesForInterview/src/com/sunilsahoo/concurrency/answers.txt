Here are my answers to the exercises:

1. The following listing answers this question:

   import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
   import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
   import java.util.concurrent.ThreadFactory;

   public class NamedThreadExecutorDemo
   {
      public static void main(String[] args)
      {
         Runnable r = new Runnable()
                      {
                         @Override
                         public void run()
                         {
                            String name = Thread.currentThread().getName();
                            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
                               System.out.printf("%s: %d%n", name, i);
                         }
                      };
         ExecutorService executor;
         executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor(new NamedThread("Foo"));
         executor.execute(r);
         executor.shutdown();
      }
   }

   class NamedThread implements ThreadFactory
   {
      private String name;

      NamedThread(String name)
      {
         this.name = name;
      }

      @Override
      public Thread newThread(Runnable r)
      {
         return new Thread(r, name);
      }
   }

   The Executors class declares an ExecutorService newSingleThreadExecutor(ThreadFactory threadFactory) class method for
   creating an Executor that uses a single worker thread operating off an unbounded queue, and uses the provided 
   ThreadFactory to create a new thread when needed.

   ThreadFactory is an interface in the java.util.concurrent package that provides the following method for creating a 
   thread:

   Thread newThread(Runnable r)

   The solution is to create a class that implements ThreadFactory and overrides this method. The class provides a 
   constructor that saves a String variable denoting the thread's name, and the overridden newThread(Runnable) method 
   passes the name to the Thread(Runnable, String) constructor. Instantiate this class and pass the instance to
   newSingleThreadExecutor(ThreadFactory).

2. To obtain a permit or be notified that one isn't available without blocking, invoke Semaphore's boolean tryAcquire()
   method.

3. The answer is false: ConcurrentHashMap doesn't provide support for locking its entire hash table in a way that prevents 
   all access.

4. To solve this problem with ConcurrentHashMap, use this class's V putIfAbsent(K key, V value) method. putIfAbsent(K, v) is
   equivalent to the following code:

   if (!map.containsKey(key))
      return map.put(key, value);
   else
      return map.get(key);

   except that the action is performed atomically.
