The following exercises challenge you to learn more about the Executors Framework, synchronizers, and concurrent collections:

1. Consider the following application that uses an executor to execute a runnable task that outputs a thread's name and a 
   loop index:

   import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
   import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;

   public class NamedThreadExecutorDemo
   {
      public static void main(String[] args)
      {
         Runnable r = new Runnable()
                      {
                         @Override
                         public void run()
                         {
                            String name = Thread.currentThread().getName();
                            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
                               System.out.printf("%s: %d%n", name, i);
                         }
                      };
         ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
         executor.execute(r);
         executor.shutdown();
      }
   }

   If you run this application, you'll see output similar to the following:

   pool-1-thread-1: 0
   pool-1-thread-1: 1
   pool-1-thread-1: 2
   pool-1-thread-1: 3
   pool-1-thread-1: 4
   pool-1-thread-1: 5
   pool-1-thread-1: 6
   pool-1-thread-1: 7
   pool-1-thread-1: 8
   pool-1-thread-1: 9

   The name of the thread is specified as pool-1-thread-1. Because this name is chosen by newSingleThreadExecutor(), you 
   cannot supply your own name. However, Executors offers a solution. Implement this solution in a new version of 
   NamedThreadExecutorDemo that outputs Foo instead of pool-1-thread-1. Hint: You only need to introduce a single class and 
   modify one line of code.

2. Semaphore's acquire() method blocks until a permit is available or the thread is interrupted. Suppose your application 
   requires that you obtain a permit or be notified that one isn't available without blocking. How do you accomplish this 
   task?

3. True or False: ConcurrentHashMap provides support for locking its entire hash table in a way that prevents all access.

4. When working with HashMap, it's common to follow the pattern demonstrated below to add a value that doesn't exist:

   synchronized (this) 
   {
      Employee emp = employees.get(name); // employees is a HashMap
      if (emp == null) 
      {
         emp = new Employee(name);
         employees.put(name, emp);
      }
      // ...
   }

   If you switched the type of employees from HashMap to ConcurrentHashMap and removed synchronized, you would encounter a
   race condition: If a new Employee was put into the employees map by another thread after the call to get() returned null, 
   put() would overwrite the value. You could solve this problem by keeping the code synchronized. However, that defeats the 
   purpose for ConcurrentHashMap because it makes your code single-threaded. How would you solve this problem?
